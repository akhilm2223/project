          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <img src="images/sustainable-tour.jpg" alt="Group of travelers" class="float-left">
          <p>Eco Travel Adventures began when our founders, experienced travelers and environmental advocates, recognized the need for tourism that actively contributes to conservation and community development rather than depleting resources.</p>
          <p>Starting with just two destinations and a handful of travelers, we've grown to offer experiences across six continents while maintaining our core values of sustainability, authenticity, and positive impact.</p>
          <p>Today, we're proud to be recognized as leaders in sustainable tourism, having received multiple awards for our innovative approaches to eco-friendly travel.</p>
